# Authentication-System

Hey
This is a basic Django project to make an Authentication system with the following features:

1. I've linked the proejct to my SQL database after creating a db consisting of a table named Person which will be used to store user information. The fields in Person table can be checked through models.py.

2. I've created 4 APIs with the following function:

Signup API: Accepts user info (name, email, password, dob) and stores it in the database.
Login API: Allows user to sign in after verifying email and password that the user enters, and giving them a JWT token.
View Details API: Allows user to view their details, using their JWT token, which is given to them during Login.
Update API: Allows user to update their details, which are also updated in the database.

3. This system uses API View and mainly works with GET, POST, PUT requests.

4. When the user tries to log in, the userâ€™s credentials (username and password) are verified and a JWT token which is generated by encoding the user-id, is shared. The user uses this token during Update and ViewDetails as a method of authentication. These functions are being taken care of in the middleware file.
